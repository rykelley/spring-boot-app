# Docker Service with ALB example

This folder shows an example of how to use the ECS modules to:

1. Deploy an ECS cluster
1. Deploy an ALB that can be shared among many ECS Services
1. Run a simple "Hello, World" web service Docker container as an ECS service
1. Use an ALB to route traffic to the ECS service

## How do you run this example?

To run this example, you need to do the following:

1. Build the AMI
1. Apply the Terraform templates

### Build the AMI

See the [example-ecs-instance-ami docs](/examples/example-ecs-instance-ami).

#### Apply the Terraform templates

To apply the Terraform templates:

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
1. Open `vars.tf`, set the environment variables specified at the top of the file, and fill in any other variables that
   don't have a default. This includes setting the `cluster_instance_ami` the ID of the AMI you just built.
1. Run `terraform get`.
1. Run `terraform plan`.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply`.
